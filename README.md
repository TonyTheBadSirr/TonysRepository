# TonysRepository
My name is Tony, and I live in a small town in Maine. I am currently attending SNHU online towards achieving my first bs in "Computer Programming & Game Design". I am studying, and practicing with Java, and Python in hopes to achieve a level of success that will qualify me for a job so I can start my journey in this area that I have dreamed of since I was a kid...which was quite some time ago considering I just turned 30 this pasy July.
